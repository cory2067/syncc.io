# Syncc
Syncc is an online collaborative coding platform that combines the real-time capabilities of Google Drive with the coding convenience of an IDE. Real-time collaboration is as easy as sharing a URL or adding collaborator's emails so that the file is additionally added to their directory. The fully customizable editor facilitates ease of use and a dynamic directory structure provides straight-forward organization. Additional features include the ability to clone directly from GitHub, file and folder upload, export or download, and the ability to execute Python and Javascript programs.
