# Syncc
Syncc is an online collaborative coding platform that combines the real-time capabilities of Google Drive with the coding convenience of an IDE. Real-time collaboration is as easy as sharing a URL or adding collaborator's emails, which then allows users to instantly edit in a fully customizable editor. Projects can also be viewed and managed with a dynamic directory structure that supports new file/folder creation and file/folder uploading. Additional features include the ability to clone directly from GitHub, export or download programs, and the ability to execute Python and Javascript programs.
